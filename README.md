# Lenia
Lenia is a 2D [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) with continuous space, time and states. Many interesting life forms can be found.

There are various versions available. Python, Matlab and JavaScript versions are real-time, interactive, and equipped with statistics tools. Jupyter and R versions are non-interactive and just for demonstration purposes.
