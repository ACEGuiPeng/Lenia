# Lenia
Lenia is a 2D [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) with continuous space, time and states. Many interesting life forms can be found with different parameters.

There are various versions available. Matlab and JavaScript versions are real-time, interactive, and equipped with statistics tools. Jupyter and R versions are static and just for demonstration purposes.

## Matlab Version
Fastest version, great tools for statistical analysis.

(you need a purchased copy of Matlab to run this version)
